This is the A\+PI for the P\+I\+C32 nrf24l01+ library. Here you will find documentation for all functions included in the library detailing their usage. To go right to a list of the functions, just \href{globals_func.html}{\tt click here! }. Alternatively, try using the search box in the upper right corner to search for any thing you need. Also, be sure to check out the documentation in the \char`\"{}\+Useful References\char`\"{} section below for a complete writeup of the library and how to use it.

\subsection*{Goals}

This library was created to simplify the use of the widely available nrf24l01+ radio module with the P\+I\+C32 microcontroller. It provides a relatively short set of functions that allow the user to take advantage of all the major functionality of the nrf24l01+ without needing to worry about the hardware of the radio.
