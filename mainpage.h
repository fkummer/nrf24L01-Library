how to use it.

<h2>
Goals</h2>
<p>This library was created to simplify the use of the widely available
nrf24l01+ radio module with the PIC32 microcontroller. It provides a
relatively short set of functions that allow the user to take
advantage of all the major functionality of the nrf24l01+ without
needing to worry about the hardware of the radio.</p>
